<h1 id="co-founder">Design</h1>

Working for startups, I've been lucky to wear many hats and have enjoyed contributing to design work over the years.

<h2 id="phd-thesis">Beautiful.ai (2020)</h2>
<p>My humble contribution to Beautiful.ai in its earlier days - the login screen.
  Back then the only UI designer was the CEO so this task fell to me.

<h2 id="phd-thesis">Inkwell (2018)</h2>
<p>My <i>magnum opus</i>. I need to go and dig out more screenshots from my backups, but for now here's the scientific word processor I designed,
  showing off its internal debugging tool.</p>

<h2 id="phd-thesis">SoftInstall.net (2007)</h2>
<p>SoftInstall was a complex tool aimed at software developers. I designed and built the GUI, following the then-new Windows Vista style.</p>

<h2 id="phd-thesis">CodeSight (2006)</h2>
<p>A mothballed developer tool that I worked on for a while. The UI was inspired by Visual Studio.</p>
